1. Start from (0,0)
2. Choose one of the possible paths to take.
3. Repeat step 2
	a. if the knight has gone through all the spots, return true
	b. if the knight cannot complete all the paths (meaning it gets stuck at some point), undo the most recent move and choose a new path.
	c. if the knight still cannot complete the paths, undo one more move than the number of moves undone previously and repeat step b.

*the starting point is irrelevant because the knight is going to touch every part of the chessboard anyways (verified through experimentation on Netlogo)
